# About Me

## Who I am

I'm Robyn Vaughan-Williams, I've been a few things now, student, baker, programmer. Grew up in the mountains of Eryri national park, off grid, making our own power, water, no landline but always a deep interest in computers. I graduated from Aberystwyth university with a degree in space science and robotics, which is a much fancier title than reality.

My "work" interests range from robotics and various embedded systems to VR technology, open source hardware and software and selfhosting.

Outside of work, I find great joy in storytelling in all it's mediums from audiobooks and full cast audio stories to tv and computer games, baking and cooking (feeding people makes me happy), pottery, community, helping others.

<!-- Most of my interests lie in using robotics and computers in farming, exploring how they could help produce more food in a sustainable manner. I feel that computers and automation really could help produce a green
world where people can easily afford the bare minimum and find themselves comfortable and happy.

My physical work involves:

- Learning how robotics can work in [real world environments](SailBot.html)
- Experimenting with how we can use computers in [environmentally sustainable](Permacomputing.html) ways,
- Teaching myself to create [low-power/high efficiency programs](ThisSite.html) and robotics,
- Learning about ideas behind farming automation and how we can produce more food whilst keeping our methods sustainable, becoming an active member of communities such as [TwistedFields](https://community.twistedfields.com/t/welcome-to-the-twisted-fields-community-forum/7),

I've been programming for most of my life. My main language is C++, but I also have multiple years of experience in C#, Python and Java and some loose experience in Typescript and C.
